### Shell Board

Cricket Scores on your shell.

# ok so how do I use it?

1. clone
2. `./cricket none` gives you match ids
3. runs as `watch -n 40 -t cricket.sh matchid` will work as `./cricket.sh` too 

# todo
1. arguments are badly passed.
2. Better match selection
3. Support other sports

Patches welcome :D
