### ok so how do I use it?

1. clone
2. `./cricket.sh` gives you match ids
3. run as `./cricket.sh -m matchid` but use `watch -n 40 -t /absolute/path/cricket.sh -m matchid` to get a nice continous update

### you must get something like this :

     Pakistan 329/6 (50 ov)
     India 132/1 (19.2 ov)
     India require another 198 runs with 9 wickets and 30.4 overs remaining
     Recent overs 1 4 1 . 1 1wd 1 | . . . . . 1 | 6 . 1nb 4 1 1 4 | 1
    Last Wicket : 
    G Gambhir lbw b Mohammad Hafeez 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
    
    
    Fall of wicket: 0/1 (0.2 ov); Partnership: 0 runs, 0.2 overs, RR: 0.00 (Tendulkar 0, Gambhir 0)
    
    India 132/1 (19.2 ov, V Kohli 72*, SR Tendulkar 52*, Saeed Ajmal 0/10)
